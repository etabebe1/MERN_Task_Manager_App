## Project Setup

In order to run the project, setup .env and set MONGO_URI variable equal to DB connection string.
In order to avoid port collisions, in the source code port value is 3000.
In case of mine I used localhost, however, user can use either localhost or Mongodb Atlas to setup MONGO_URI connection
